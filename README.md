Data Analysis / Observations:
The Max Temperatures are higher the closer you travel towards the equator (i.e. 0 deg latitude).
The r-value for this dataset show distance from the equator and Max Temperatures are correlated.

There appears to be no relationship among Humidity, Cloudiness, Windspeed and a country's latitude or location to the equator.

The Southern Hemisphere Wind Speed vs Latitude Linear Regression resulted in a negative r. This may mean there is a negative relationship
between wind speed in the Southern Hemisphere and a country's latitude.

Two of the ideal cities retrieved on one final list were located in Iran. This would mean the analysis has its limitations. 
It does not take into account the geopolitical strife that may be present in the locations that are randomly selected.
